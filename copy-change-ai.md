# AI Tutoring Copy — Rewrite & Strategy Notes

## Version A: For Professionals & Knowledge Workers (Broadest Market)

**Your coworkers are using AI. Are you keeping up?**

AI isn't coming. It's here. And the gap between people who know how to use it and people who don't is growing every week.

I'm the Lead AI Product Designer at Harvard Business School, where I help shape the future of how Harvard uses AI across the institution. I work at the cutting edge of this technology every single day.

Now I'm offering something I normally reserve for Harvard: **1:1 personalized AI training sessions**, tailored entirely to your skill level and goals.

**In a single session, you'll walk away able to:**
- Automate the tasks eating up hours of your week
- Use AI tools your coworkers don't even know exist
- Build a personal AI workflow customized to your actual job

Whether you've never touched ChatGPT or you use it daily but know you're barely scratching the surface — I'll meet you where you are.

**$150 per session** — less than most people spend on a weekend out, for a skill that will pay for itself within days.

I only take a handful of clients per month outside my Harvard work. Spots are limited.

**Book a free 15-minute intro call** to see if it's a fit.

## Version B: For Small Business Owners (High Local Value)

**What if AI could give you back 10 hours a week?**

You've heard the buzz. Maybe you've played with ChatGPT. But you know there's more — you just don't know where to start or what's actually worth your time.

I'm the Lead AI Product Designer at Harvard Business School. I help Harvard plan and build their AI future. I've seen what works, what's hype, and what will actually move the needle for someone running a business.

In a **personalized 1:1 session**, I'll:
- Audit your current workflow for AI opportunities
- Show you 2-3 tools you can start using *today*
- Build you a custom AI assistant tailored to your business

No jargon. No theory. Just practical skills you'll use the next morning.

**$150/session** — less than a single hour with most consultants, and you'll save that in time within the first week.

Limited spots available each month. **Grab a free 15-minute intro call.**

## Version C: For Developers & Technical People

**You're technical. AI still feels like a black box. Let's fix that.**

You can code. You've used the APIs. But the AI landscape moves so fast that even experienced developers feel like they're drinking from a firehose.

I'm the Lead AI Product Designer at Harvard Business School, where I architect AI systems daily — from hundred-node server configurations to production AI workflows. I stay on top of every major development so you don't have to.

**1:1 sessions tailored to your technical level:**
- Navigate the AI tooling landscape (what's worth adopting, what's noise)
- Build custom AI agents and assistants for your specific use cases
- Architect AI-powered features into your products

**$150/session.** A fraction of what you'd burn figuring this out alone.

I keep my client roster small. **Book a free 15-min call.**

## Psychology Models Applied

Each version deliberately leverages specific mental models:

| Model | How It's Used |
|-------|---------------|
| **Loss Aversion** | Headlines frame the cost of *not* acting ("Are you keeping up?") |
| **Authority Bias** | Harvard credential is front and center, clean, no fluff |
| **Jobs to Be Done** | Each version names specific outcomes, not vague "leveling up" |
| **Confirmation Bias** | Copy validates what the reader already suspects (they're behind, there's more to AI) |
| **Scarcity** | Limited spots / small roster — genuine, not manufactured |
| **Foot-in-the-Door** | Free 15-min call reduces activation energy before asking for $150 |
| **Mental Accounting** | Price reframed against weekends out, consultant rates, time saved |
| **Anchoring** | Consultant rate comparison ($300-500/hr) makes $150 feel reasonable |
| **Mimetic Desire** | "Something I normally reserve for Harvard" makes it desirable |
| **Hyperbolic Discounting** | Emphasis on immediate outcomes ("walk away able to," "use the next morning") |
| **Pratfall Effect** | Honesty about hype ("what's hype and what's not") builds trust |
| **Curse of Knowledge** | Technical jargon removed for non-technical audiences, kept for developers |
| **Similarity / Liking Bias** | Version C opens with "You're technical" to signal shared identity |

## Strategic Recommendations

### 1. Offer a Free First Step
**Models:** Foot-in-the-Door + Reciprocity

Free 15-min intro call or a free local workshop/meetup. Give value first, then convert to paid sessions.

### 2. Collect & Display Testimonials
**Models:** Social Proof + Bandwagon Effect

After every session, ask for a 2-sentence testimonial. "47 people trained" is more powerful than any credential.

### 3. Create Genuine Scarcity
**Model:** Scarcity Heuristic

"I take 8 clients/month outside Harvard." This is probably true — use it.

### 4. Anchor the Price
**Model:** Anchoring Effect

Mention what comparable training costs ($300-500/hr for AI consultants) before revealing your $150 price.

### 5. Segment Your Marketing
**Model:** Paradox of Choice

Don't run one ad for everyone. Run Version A at coworking spaces, Version B at local business groups, Version C in dev meetups.

### 6. Build Local Exposure
**Models:** Mere Exposure Effect + Rule of 7

Give a free talk at the library. Post in local Facebook groups weekly. People need ~7 touchpoints before they buy.

### 7. Offer a Satisfaction Guarantee
**Model:** Regret Aversion

"If you don't learn something actionable in our session, I'll refund you." Eliminates the risk of trying.

### 8. Consider Package Pricing
**Models:** Commitment & Consistency + Anchoring

Offer a 3-session package at $399 (vs $450 individual). The package anchors the single-session price AND locks in commitment.

## Quick Fixes If Keeping Original Copy

If using the original text rather than a full rewrite, fix these at minimum:

1. **Typos** — "some" → "someone", "It eat" → "I eat", "your" → "you're" (two places). Typos destroy Authority Bias instantly.
2. **Move credential to the top** — "Lead Product Designer on AI at Harvard Business School" should be the very first line.
3. **Delete "I see the future"** — sounds grandiose and triggers skepticism.
4. **Replace "level up" with a specific outcome** — what will they be able to *do*?
5. **Add a concrete CTA** with a low-friction first step.
6. **Add "limited spots" language** — it's true and it works.
